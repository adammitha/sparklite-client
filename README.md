# SparkLite Client Library

This repository contains a Rust library that implements the client protocol for the SparkLite distributed data analysis framework.

It also contains a small command-line program that demonstrates the library's basic functionality.

See the [DESIGN](./DESIGN.md) file for more details about the design of the SparkLite client.
